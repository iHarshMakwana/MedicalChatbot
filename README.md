🏥 Medical Chatbot - AI-Powered Symptom Checker

📌 Project Description

This Medical Chatbot is a web-based AI tool designed to help users identify potential illnesses based on their symptoms. It utilizes Machine Learning (TensorFlow) to classify symptoms and provide first-aid guidance. The chatbot is built with Flask, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn and is structured for easy deployment and GitHub integration.

🚀 How It Works

User Inputs Symptoms – The chatbot receives a message from the user (e.g., "I have a cough and fever").

AI Predicts the Disease – A trained Neural Network Model processes the text and predicts the possible disease.

Guidance is Provided – The chatbot suggests first-aid measures based on the detected illness.

Unknown Symptoms? – If the symptom is not recognized, the bot advises the user to consult a doctor.
